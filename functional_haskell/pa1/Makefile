# NOTE: Setting SHELL to `zsh` (rather than the default `sh`) for its
# nicer input redirection and command substitution, used in test-2
# through test-9. If you don't have `zsh`, comment out this line, and
# either create explicit intermediate files (see test-1) or search
# --- chat with your trusty AI? --- for more ways to mix commands
# and input redirection than I (Ravi) care to learn right now.
